RII of 1.12 (rough overall score in 2021/22) suggest predicted % for most deprived is 12% lower than for least deprived. So if % positive rate was 90 for least deprived we would predict score of 85% for most deprived in 2011/12 but 78% in 2021/22.\nMain takeaway is that, apart from the access question, the relative difference in positive responses has widened over time i.e.Â inequality in satisfaction is getting worse."
